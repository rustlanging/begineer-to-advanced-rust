// notes on functiond exercise
// Exercises

// Redo the same exercises from the Rust handbook, but this time use 
// functions wherever it makes sense. You can use your previous 
// solution and extract functions out of it; or you can start from scratch.

// Furthermore, after watching the video, also research online how the 
// following questions:

// Are function calls stored on the Stack or on the Heap? Why is one 
// more beneficial than the other? 
// What is Memoization and how does it help executing recursion faster?
// What is Tail recursion (Tail Call Optimization) and how does it help 
// executing recursion faster?

fn main() {
    // 1. Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
    let celsius1 = 37.0;
    let celsius2 = 0.0;
    let farenheit1 = 32.0;
    let farenheit2 = 104.0;
 
    println!("0.0 C = 32.0 F");
   
    // 2. Generate the nth Fibonacci number.
    let n = 15;
   
    // 3. Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol
    // “The Twelve Days of Christmas,”
    // taking advantage of the repetition in the song.
